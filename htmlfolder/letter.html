    <p>On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the<br>
            overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers,<br>
            footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create<br>
            pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. </p>

        <p>You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by <br>
                choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab.<br> 
                You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most<br>
                controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme or using a format that <br>
                you specify directly.</p> 

    
        <p>To change the overall look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the <br> 
                Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the <br> 
                Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick <br>
                Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the look of your br
                document to the original contained in your current template. 
            </p>        

            <p>Regards,</p>
